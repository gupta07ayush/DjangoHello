Here is the current deployment checklist:

1.install Gunicorn as a WSGI server
2.generate a requirements.txt file
3.update ALLOWED_HOSTS in django_project/settings.py
4.add a .dockerignore file


The first step is to install Gunicorn, a production-ready WSGI server for our project. Gunicorn replaces the Django local development server and–as with all Python packages–is installable via Pip.

(.venv) $ python -m pip install gunicorn==20.1.0
